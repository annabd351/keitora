// Shared, optimistic project-switch path behind App.tsx's `handleSwitchProject`,
// which every project switcher in the UI (and the keyboard cycle) goes through.
//
// Why this lives in its own file (not `ipc.ts`): it needs the React `setProject`
// state setter so it can flip the App-level `project` state immediately. It is a
// plain async function, NOT a hook — the caller passes `setProject`, the current
// project value, and a `showToast` callback as parameters. That keeps it usable
// from any callback.
//
// Mechanism: when the caller already holds the target `ProjectSummary`, flip the
// UI optimistically before the backend round-trip. `set_active_project` writes
// the user config file; the backend config-file watcher detects that write and
// fires `project://changed`, which drives `loadProject()` → `setProject` again
// with the reconciled value (same data — no flicker). On error, revert.
